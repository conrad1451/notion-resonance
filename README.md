# NotionAPI JavaScript SDK Example

This project showcases one of the many possibilities of NotionAPI.

Here I created an Express server and connected to a database on Notion via the Notion API.

The end result is a web page that displays information from our Notion database and also allows users to create new records.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* A [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) account

## Running the app

If you would like to run this project, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory

In this file you should add your Notion API key and your Database ID like so:

```bash
NOTION_API_KEY = [Here you should insert your key]
NOTION_API_DATABASE = [Here you should insert your key]
```

If you don't know how to get your key, go to [developers.notion.com](https://developers.notion.com/), press _My Integrations_, choose _New Integration_ and once you fill all the info, you should get an `Internal Integration Token`.

If you don't know how to get your Database id, check the **Where can I find my database's ID?** section of this [NotionAPI doc](https://developers.notion.com/docs/working-with-databases)
